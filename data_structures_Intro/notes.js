//? data structure - collection of values and the value can have relationship amongst them
data structure is like a container or department (e.g a bag, packing box)
and each container is good for its own thing
we can not place a liquid food inside a bag and similarly we can't place a shoes inside a fridge

DS is responsible for storing data and retrieving it easily

Block chain, itself is a data structure which holds information
In daily life, we organize the most of things for easy retrieval 

Data needs to be stored in different format

//* How Computers Store DATA

Variables stored in RAM
Medial files- VIdeo.music or audio or docs stored in STORAGE
Data storage is persistent or in simple words, its permanent


//*! Then why we don't use STORAGE for storing Variables, as we lose memory in RAM when the computer is switched off?
//*? CPU accesses the RAM much faster than the STORAGE, therefore if we store the varialbes in STORAGE, it will make the process slow
//*? We can access any random memory in RAM very fast 


//*? 8-bit(11111111) - 255 bits of information;
//*?  16-bit - 65,536, 32-bit - 2,147,483,674 ; 64-bit - 9,223,372,036,854,775,807

Each data type has a number of bit associated with it and it needs to store in the system
then system allocate that space and CPU reads that info.

DS- the arrangement of DATA
we can arrange the data in RAM 


//*todo Our goal is to minimize the operation that we need to do for the CPU to get the information.
//*todo and that is why DS is very powerful

//* THE MAIN DS AND ALGO TO LEARN

//*! Arrays, Trees, Stacks, Tries, Queues, Graphs, LL, Hashtables
//*! Sorting, DP, BFS+DFS(searching), Recursion
